Hey! Thanks for yor time, it was really plesent to be able to learn from you and attend bootcamp. 

My code is a trainwreck, with very few working components.

What is working: Registration, Login, Comenting, display posts, Add posts, User infor, Info about uploaded posts.

What should have worked but didn't: assign category to posts, title is asigned for category and i was searching why but couldn't
answer in time. DELETE post - Wrote, but wasn't able to test it, because of problem with MongoDB, DELETE Comments- Logic was 
written but not tested,

What was never done: getPostByCategory (logic was created, but couldn't be tested because of issues),
Update post information, get comments by user.

I think That is it. Thanks for your time Moris, and i wish u all the best!!
